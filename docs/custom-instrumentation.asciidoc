[[custom-instrumentation]]
=== Custom instrumentation

When installed ElasticAPM will automatically wrap your app's request/responses in transactions and report its errors.

But it is possible to create your own transactions as well as provide spans for any automatic or custom transaction.

See <<api-transaction,`ElasticAPM.transaction`>> and <<api-span,`ElasticAPM.span`>>.

[[injectors]]
=== Injectors -- automatic integrations with third-party libraries

ElasticAPM has built-in integrations for some popular libraries. Use `config.enabled_injectors` to add or remove specific integrations. See <<configuration,Configuration>>.
